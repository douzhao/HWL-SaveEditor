# HWL-SaveEditor (3DS)
This is an Save-Editor for the game Hyrule Warriors Legends (Nintendo 3DS)

It's written in C++ and with MS Visual Studio 2013. You need that compiler for compiling the gui. (MFC application). 
It should be possible to compile the core/console variant with gcc on Windows.

The main-files are located at source/core (all main functions are located here).

## Prerequisites
You should have a Version of SaveFiler (or able to use .cia files on your 3DS) or able to run homebrew to get your savefile of the game. 
Possible Homebrew for exporting a savefile: svdt, 3DS Save Manager and/or JK3DSTool (as a .3dsx file), search for it with your favourite search-engine ;) 
If you not able to run homebrew yet, then visit http://smealum.github.io/3ds/ for more information. 

## How to use it? 
First, download the latest stable release!
Once you have your savefile (normally called "zmha.bin"), copy to your PC, made a backup of that savefile before you edit anything, run the editor, open the savefile and change what you want, save the file, copy it back to your 3DS SD-Card and import it back with the programm, you used before to get the savefile.
